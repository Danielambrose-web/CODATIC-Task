Task 1: Portfolio Project Manager
Description:
Write a function addProject that takes a project name as a parameter and adds it to a global array called projects using push. Create another function removeLastProject that removes the last project using pop. Log the updated array after each operation.
Requirements:
Use a global projects array initialized with 2 project names (e.g., ["Portfolio Website", "Task Tracker"]).
addProject should accept a project name (string) and add it to projects.
removeLastProject should remove and return the last project.
Test both functions in script.js with console.log.
Explanation for Students:
“This task is like managing a to-do list for your portfolio projects. Imagine projects is a list on your desk, and addProject is like writing a new item at the end with a pen (push). removeLastProject is like erasing the last item (pop). The array lives globally, so both functions can access it—like a shared notebook everyone in your team can see. We use console.log to check our list after each change, just like checking your work in a mirror.”
Why It’s Useful:
Reinforces push and pop for array manipulation.
Introduces global scope (projects array accessible everywhere).
